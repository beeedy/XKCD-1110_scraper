This simple script holds as one of my first experiments with Python, PIL, and urllib. This script does not follow best practice and should only be viewed as a begineners attempt at Python. The script notably has performance issues regarding computation time and memory consumption. All around this is a poor script. It does work! Just don't use it. 

The script itself grabs all the individual images that comprise the XKCD comic 1110 and combines them into a single image. It really is that simple.
